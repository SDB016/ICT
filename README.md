Title: can u see me?
It is basically an app that is used with door lock hardware. If you touch the touchpad where only the position is displayed without numbers, Art Mega (mcu) will send the position value to the app.
The app randomly mixes an array of numbers. In the meantime, if a position value is entered from Art Mega, it will match the randomly arranged numbers and compare with the preset password. It then sends an Art Megalo match, and if it matches, it opens the door lock and beeps if it fails.

This project is an application application for 2020 ICT open call for participants sponsored by Device Mart.
